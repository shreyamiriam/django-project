<p>In the short span of its existence, Rajagiri Hospital has created its niche on the map of quality healthcare delivery in South India by touching nearly 2 million lives. Having earned the trust and loyalty of patients through the compassion of its caregivers and high-precision medical technology, the institution has emerged as the leading quaternary care facility in the region. 

Rajagiri Hospital, established in 2014 was a thoughtful initiative from the renowned Rajagiri (CMI) group of institutions to offer quality and affordable medical care to the common man. The legacy of Rajagiri in pioneering a distinctive culture in the educational sector has helped them carve an exemplary medical institution in Kerala. The hospital is well laid out in a 40 acre green landscape in the serene setting of Chunangamvely, Aluva and is the closest facility to the Cochin International Airport. 

The consistent pursuit of achieving uncompromised excellence in healthcare has won Rajagiri Hospital many accolades and appreciation on national and international platforms. The Hospital is accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI) with the gold seal for complying with the highest international standards on patient safety and quality of care. The hospital is also accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH), National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories (NABL) and NABH certification for Nursing Excellence and has received ISO 22000:2005 certification for its Food & Beverages services.

The synergy of western medicine and Ayurveda, offers the patients a holistic healing experience. Integrating telehealth technology to its service spectrum, Rajagiri Hospital has paved the way to reach out to patients beyond borders. Today, the Hospital has grown to be the first choice among the domestic and international patients for their healthcare needs.
A hospital is a health care institution providing patient treatment with specialized health science and auxiliary healthcare staff and medical equipment.[2] The best-known type of hospital is the general hospital, which typically has an emergency department to treat urgent health problems ranging from fire and accident victims to a sudden illness. A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with many beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialized hospitals include trauma centers, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialized hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.[3] Hospitals are classified as general, specialty, or government depending on the sources of income received.

A teaching hospital combines assistance to people with teaching to health science students and auxiliary healthcare students. A health science facility smaller than a hospital is generally called a clinic. Hospitals have a range of departments (e.g. surgery and urgent care) and specialist units such as cardiology. Some hospitals have outpatient departments and some have chronic treatment units. Common support units include a pharmacy, pathology, and radiology.

Hospitals are typically funded by public funding, health organisations (for-profit or nonprofit), health insurance companies, or charities, including direct charitable donations. Historically, hospitals were often founded and funded by religious orders, or by charitable individuals and leaders.[4]

Currently, hospitals are largely staffed by professional physicians, surgeons, nurses, and allied health practitioners, whereas in the past, this work was usually performed by the members of founding religious orders or by volunteers. However, there are various Catholic religious orders, such as the Alexians and the Bon Secours Sisters that still focus on hospital ministry in the late 1990s, as well as several other Christian denominations, including the Methodists and Lutherans, which run hospitals.[5] In accordance with the original meaning of the word, hospitals were original "places of hospitality", and this meaning is still preserved in the names of some institutions such as the Royal Hospital Chelsea, established in 1681 as a retirement and nursing home for veteran soldiers.
